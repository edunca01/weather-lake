"""Compaction: merge a curated partition's small files into one.

Live polling writes one ``part-<posted>.parquet`` per posting and valid day: an hourly poll
over an 8-day horizon adds 8 small files an hour, and each valid day collects ~190 of them.
Every point-in-time read opens every file of the days it covers, and on S3 each file is a
request, so small files cost both latency and money. Compaction rewrites them as one
``merged-<compacted>.parquet``.

Guarantees:

- Only ``curated/`` is touched; raw responses are never read, moved or deleted.
- Rows are never changed or dropped, duplicates inside a posting included. If an earlier run
  was interrupted after writing its merged file, the sources it already holds are recognised
  (every one of their rows is in the newest merged file) and removed instead of merged twice.
- Files younger than ``MIN_AGE`` (by write time) are left alone: ingest may still be writing
  that partition, and a backfill writes old postings now.
- The merged file is written before any source is deleted, so an interruption can leave extra
  files but never lose rows.
- A run can be told to stop between partitions (``stop``), so a large backlog is worked
  through over several runs instead of one being killed mid-partition by its time limit.
- A partition with a file that differs from the contract (columns, types, or a null in a
  required column) is skipped and logged, never coerced. A file that differs only in the
  nullable flag is relabelled, since it holds the same data.
